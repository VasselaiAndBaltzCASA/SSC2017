We propose to construct an agent-based model which compares the power of political information delivered through peoples’ personal networks to the power of information delivered to people by political parties. In this model, each agent has an initial guess about what the parties’ positions are. Agents, situated in a relational network, then receive information about party positions in two ways. The most direct source of information is the parties themselves, who distribute information about their positions. But agents also communicate information about party positions to one another. Information passed from parties and from agents can both be subject to inaccuracies or alterations. Once an agent receives new information about the parties it updates its impressions of them, and may change its party identification accordingly. This model will provide insight into how different types of information flow affect party identification in a simulated electorate. This enables the exploration of such topical concerns as the formation of partisan bubbles, the impact of fake news, and the stability of party identification.
